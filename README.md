Description: Exercise to make the Pacman move from left to right within a specific boundary, while transitioning from mouth open to mouth closed.

Future Improvements: In the future I intend to improve the code and make the PacMan move in all directions, not just back and forth on the x axis.

Installation: Opensourse.

Usage: Practice movement and changing direction along the x axis.
